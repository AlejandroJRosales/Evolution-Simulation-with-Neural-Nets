# NextGen-My-Simple-Game-
A simple world simulation. Basically, it is a genetic algorithm. There are tree species, Humans, Gritiss, and Drakonians.
Each has a special skill. Through evoultion, each generation gets better as the weak are weeded out and the strong crossover and their
young mutate. A simple display or the population gives a summary of how the population is doing. Such as the strongest species, the 
strongest creature, and the median creatures for each species. A better fromat will hopefully be coming later. I am looking to continue
to imporve this game for the rest of my life. Bascially, way down the road, adding in morals and machine learning and a better, easier-on-
the-eyes display. Basically,  to simulate life is the goal. A far cry from what I have now, but it is the goal nonetheless.
