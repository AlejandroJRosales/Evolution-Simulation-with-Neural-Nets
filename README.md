# My Simple Simulation
A simple world simulation. Basically, it is a glorified genetic algorithm. There are three species, Humans, Gritiss, and Drakonians.
Each species has a special skill. Through evolution, each generation becomes better as the weak are weeded out and the strong crossover and their young mutate. A normal distribution is implemented for all traits for the initiation of the starting population and "new blood" population. Population size grows over time. Extinction is all too real for each species. For a species can overtake them all or infectious disease can wipe out many. 

A simple display or the population gives a summary of how the population is doing. Such as the median creature for each species and the population size of each species. A better format will hopefully be coming later. I am looking to continue to improve this game for the rest of my life. Basically, way down the road, adding in morals and machine learning and a better, easier-on-the-eyes display. Basically,  to simulate *life* is the goal. A far cry from what I have now, but it is the goal nonetheless.
