# My Simple Simulation
A simple world simulation. Basically, it is a genetic algorithm. There are three species, Humans, Gritiss, and Drakonians.
Each species has a special skill. Through evoultion, each generation gets better as the weak are weeded out and the strong crossover and their young mutate. Population size grows over time. Extinction is all too real for each species. A simple display or the population gives a summary of how the population is doing. Such as the strongest species and the median creatures for each species. A better fromat will hopefully be coming later. I am looking to continue to imporve this game for the rest of my life. Bascially, way down the road, adding in morals and machine learning and a better, easier-on-the-eyes display. Basically,  to simulate *life* is the goal. A far cry from what I have now, but it is the goal nonetheless.
