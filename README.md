# My Simple Simulation
A simple world simulation. Basically, it is a genetic algorithm. There are three species, Humans, Gritiss, and Drakonians.
Each species has a special skill. Through evoultion, each generation becomes better as the weak are weeded out and the strong crossover and their young mutate. A normal distribution is implemented for all traits for the initiation of the starting population. Population size grows over time. Extinction is all too real for each species. A simple display or the population gives a summary of how the population is doing. Such as the median creature for each species and the population size of each species. A better fromat will hopefully be coming later. I am looking to continue to imporve this game for the rest of my life. Bascially, way down the road, adding in morals and machine learning and a better, easier-on-the-eyes display. Basically,  to simulate *life* is the goal. A far cry from what I have now, but it is the goal nonetheless.
